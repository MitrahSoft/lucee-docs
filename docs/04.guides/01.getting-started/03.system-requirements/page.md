## **System Requirements:** ##

The basic requirement for running Lucee is a servlet engine. So basically if a servlet engine is available for your system, Lucee will most probably run on it. It even runs on a RaspberryPi.

Of course there are different recommendations that go with the different operating systems. Here are general guidelines for each OS.

### Java Versions ###

Lucee 5.3 and 5.4 support Java 8 and 11

Lucee 6 will support Java 11 on release, with Java 8 unofficially supported as long as practical 

Full Java 17 support is planned for a later 6 point release, it currently mostly works, see <https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-3807>

If you do run into problems running on **newer versions** of Java with Lucee 6, please report any problems to the developer forum [Lucee Dev](https://dev.lucee.org)
