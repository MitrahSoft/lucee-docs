### Stable future ###

There's no need to worry that Lucee may disappear any time soon - investment from leading software houses, in the US & Europe, means that Lucee's future is assured for the foreseeable future.

### Fast ###

Performance is at the heart of what we do. Lucee has built the highest performing CFML engine available, so if you want to get more out of your servers and deliver a better experience to end-users of your sites, you owe it to yourself to try out Lucee Server.

### Quick to prototype ###

Lucee server uses CFML & CFScript - the familiar tag-based language & its scripted counterpart - meaning that you can prototype applications really quickly. Whether you're from a tag or script background, you can produce code in the way that suits you best.

And to get started, there's no need even to install Lucee Server. You can download our standalone version and be up and running in minutes.

### Robust deployment ###

Some development tools are great for development... but Lucee Server's all about stability. It's robust Java-based architecture means that you can have the confidence to deploy mission-critical applications and know they're just going to work.

### Object-oriented ###

If you're used to older versions of CFML, you'll love the new language features in Lucee Server. Lucee Server supports magic functions that automatically call getters and setters. It will now run implicit constructors, saving you from writing init methods. It supports interfaces and typing.

In short, it has everything you need to write robust OO code quickly - and it's all available in CFML & CFScript too.

### Cross-platform ###

Deploy on to a variety of local and cloud platforms - including Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Amazon Elastic Beanstalk services. Because Lucee's built with Java, you can deploy to your Java platform of choice.

### Scalable ###

You might want to start with the single machine non-installed version, but, when your application grows, we're still here for you. Lucee Server supports clustering with ease, and its robust clustering model will automatically sync data between clustered servers if a machine fails.

### Extendible ###

Lucee Server does most of what you'll need already... but if there's anything missing, you can extend it!

* Add built-in tags, functions & event gateways with CFML & CFScript
* Extend Lucee Server with Java classes & libraries
* Get extensions built by Lucee and others with our built-in extension library
* Download, modify & build Lucee Server's source
* Build admin plugins to extend the Lucee Server administrator functions
