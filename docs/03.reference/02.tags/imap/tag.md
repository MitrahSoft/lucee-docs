Retrieves and deletes email messages from an IMAP email server.

This tag works exactly the same way as the [[tag-pop]] tag. It has the same attributes.

The Internet Message Access Protocol or IMAP is one of two of the most prevalent Internet standard protocols for email retrieval, the other being POP3. Virtually all modern email clients and servers support both protocols as a means of transferring email messages from a server, such as those used by Gmail, or to a client such as Mozilla Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook.

Many implementations of webmail use IMAP to retrieve email messages from a server and display them within a web browser, making the use of this protocol transparent to the user.
